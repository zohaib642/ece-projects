**Buck Converter (PWM Control)**
Design and analysis of a DC-DC buck converter circuit using PWM control. Explores the relationship between switching frequency (50-100 kHz), duty cycle, and output voltage regulation. Includes current sensing measurements and characterization of the linear relationship between op-amp output and load voltage.

**Stone Game (LC-3 Assembly)**
A two-player Nim-style strategy game implemented in LC-3 assembly language. Players alternate removing stones from three rows (A, B, C), with the player who takes the last stone winning. Features input validation, game state management, and a complete turn-based game loop.
